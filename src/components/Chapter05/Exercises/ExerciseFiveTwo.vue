      <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
      <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><em>sous vide</em></dfn>
        In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath
        that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the foot to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
        Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
      </p>

      <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide Salmon</em>
        with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef
        table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time></p>

      <p>Warning:<br><b>Sous vide cooked salmon is not
        pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
        immunity issues.</b></p>
